Time really does escape you. A harsh mistress, with no free passes given. I've been so busy with work and life that I almost forgot how to post to here. I've been writing, but not publishing. I've been thinking, but not sharing. I've been living, but not reflecting. 

**TRUTH BE TOLD:** I've been learning a lot about myself, after reflecting on some of the books that I've recently rea - including Walter Isaacson's new biography of Elon Musk, Oliver Burkeman's 'Four Thousand Weeks', and 'Anatomy of a Breakthrough' by Adam Alter.

I have to be honest with you, I'm still trying to find my voice at the moment.

To me, that sounds funny to say out loud -- as I'm often found tapping away at my keyboard most hours of most days. Happy. Content. Mind wandering.  

But for the past few years I've been writing for an audience of one, me. I haven't published anything online. I guess this is due to a mixture of me being busy, not *really* wanting to show my authentic-self to the world, and not knowing what I'd want from opening up.

So for now I'm going to keep writing for an audience of one, but I'll place the notebook on a table for others to stumble upon. Maybe over time I can get some feedback to help me on my search for my authentic voice, finding what resonates.
