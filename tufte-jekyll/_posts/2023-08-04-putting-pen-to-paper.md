Lost in the rhythm of typing, I've always found a joy in writing. *Tap*, *tap*, *tap*,  but always for an audience of one - **me**. Now, though still hesitant to fully embrase my "authentic-self", I am taking small steps toward inviting you into my world.

**BEHIND THE STORY:** This is an exploration of finding my voice amidst hesitation, a journey that inspires others to pursue authenticity in their own expressions.

I have to be honest with you, I'm still trying to find my voice at the moment.

To me, that sounds funny to say out loud -- as I'm often found tapping away at my keyboard most hours of most days. Happy. Content. Mind wandering.  

But for the past few years I've been writing for an audience of one, me. I haven't published anything online. I guess this is due to a mixture of me being busy, not *really* wanting to show my authentic-self to the world, and not knowing what I'd want from opening up.

So for now I'm going to keep writing for an audience of one, but I'll place the notebook on a table for others to stumble upon. Maybe over time I can get some feedback to help me on my search for my authentic voice, finding what resonates.
