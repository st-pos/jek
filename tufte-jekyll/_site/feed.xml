        <title>Remembering how to post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Time really does escape you. A harsh mistress, with no free passes given. I’ve been so busy with work and life that I almost forgot how to post to here. I’ve been writing, but not publishing. I’ve been thinking, but not sharing. I’ve been living, but not reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest with you, I’m still trying to find my voice at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, that sounds funny to say out loud – as I’m often found tapping away at my keyboard most hours of most days. Happy. Content. Mind wandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the past few years I’ve been writing for an audience of one, me. I haven’t published anything online. I guess this is due to a mixture of me being busy, not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanting to show my authentic-self to the world, and not knowing what I’d want from opening up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now I’m going to keep writing for an audience of one, but I’ll place the notebook on a table for others to stumble upon. Maybe over time I can get some feedback to help me on my search for my authentic voice, finding what resonates.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Putting pen to paper</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy writing. But always for an audience of one… &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, though still hesitant to fully embrace my “authentic-self”, I am taking small steps toward inviting you into my world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEHIND THE STORY:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an exploration of finding my voice amidst hesitation, a journey that I hope inspires others to pursue authenticity in their own expressions.
