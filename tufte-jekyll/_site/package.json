  "description": "The *Tufte-Jekyll* blog theme is based on the github repository by Edward Tufte [here](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css), which was orginally created by Dave Leipmann, but is now labeled under Edward Tufte's moniker. I borrowed freely from the Tufte-CSS repo and have transformed many of the typographic and page-structural features into a set of custom Liquid tags that make creating content using this style much easier than writing straight HTML. Essentially, if you know markdown, and mix in a few custom Liquid tags, you can be creating a website with this document style in short order.",
